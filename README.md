# Comments
day 9 and day 8 could be solved much much faster with the correct cache optimizations but I'm not gonna bother, I'm quite happy with my solutions, they should work for any input.

if you run day 8 do not be scared by the completion bar, it finished around 2-3% it's there to see the speed at which it solves iterations of the loop.
